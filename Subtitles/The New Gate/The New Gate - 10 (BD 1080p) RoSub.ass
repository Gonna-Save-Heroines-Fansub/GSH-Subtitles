Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.81,0:07:30.42,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,Oh, this?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.42,0:07:32.46,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,In our kingdom, it's customary for a man

Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.04,0:07:39.34,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,She'd use it to cut him down \Nif he were unfaithful.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.34,0:07:41.59,Default,SHIN,0,0,0,,Well, that's unsettling.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.59,0:07:43.98,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,These days, it's just a formality.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.98,0:07:51.36,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,Anyway, I'd like to consider this sword that \Ncrashed into my bedchamber a gift from you.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.36,0:07:55.67,Default,SHIN,0,0,0,,Wouldn't that imply I'd proposed to you?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.67,0:07:57.51,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,Yes, I suppose it would.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.51,0:08:01.25,Default,SHIN,0,0,0,,It was only an accident \Nthat the sword went flying...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.25,0:08:05.00,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,I know. I won't force the matter.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.00,0:08:09.29,Default,GADRAS,0,0,0,,However, there are those plotting to leverage\Nthis incident to arrest you as a criminal
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.29,0:08:13.23,Default,GADRAS,0,0,0,,and have you gradually repay \Nthe kingdom through service.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.23,0:08:17.89,Default,SHIN,0,0,0,,Well, even if it wasn't on purpose,\Nit easily could have killed someone.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.22,0:08:20.89,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,So I suggest we treat it as tribute.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.18,0:08:25.97,Default,SHIN,0,0,0,,I see. We can treat it as tribute \Ninstead of a marriage proposal.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.97,0:08:29.02,Default,SHIN,0,0,0,,That way, you're officially presented \Nwith a powerful weapon.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.02,0:08:32.89,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,And you can get the kingdom off your back.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.89,0:08:35.23,Default,GADRAS,0,0,0,,It does sound a bit forced, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.23,0:08:39.41,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,Naturally, I shall compensate him\Nfor the blade from my own coffers.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.72,0:08:42.77,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,I understand that we stand to gain \Nmore from this arrangement,

Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.10,0:08:59.30,Default,SHIN,0,0,0,,Instead, could you allow me access to the\N restricted zones of the magical library?

Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.86,0:09:21.94,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,Of course. To tell you the truth, \NI've already used it a few times.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.94,0:09:23.54,Default,RIONNE,0,0,0,,It's starting to feel good in my hand.
